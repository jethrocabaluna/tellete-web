## Tellete

From the combination of the word "tell" and "delete", this is a decentralized messaging app that focuses on privacy.

This uses the smart contract [MessageRelay](https://github.com/jethrocabaluna/tellete-contracts) and the main functionality is that upon receiving a message from another user, that message will be deleted on the contract's state as well.

The messages and contacts are saved on the localStorage in which you are free to clear anytime.

With the use of asymmetric encryption, the messages on the localStorage and the smart contract's state are encrypted, and can only be decrypted by the receiver.

Users can register with Metamask, by connecting your wallet and using a new username which will be linked to your public address.
